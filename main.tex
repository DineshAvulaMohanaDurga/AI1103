    Problem 1.10
\end{center}
\textbf{Given Question:-}\\
There are 5\% defective items in a large bulk of items.What is the probability that a sample of 10 items will not contain more than one defective items.\\
\textbf{Given data:-}\\
Given percentage of defective items in a bunch of items= 5\\
$\Rightarrow$ probability of an item to be defective \hspace{0.8
cm}= 5$ \% $\hspace{15pt} = 0.05\\
$\Rightarrow$ probability of an item to be non-defective = 1-0.05 = 95$\%$\\
\textbf{Required to find :-} Probability that a sample of 10 items will not contain more than 1 defective items.\\
Lets assume that we are given 10 items.\\
probability that all of them are non defective = $(0.95)^{10}$
\begin{flushright}
$\because$ probability of n independent \hspace*{1.8in} \\ events happening simultaneously= $p_1 \times p_2 \times ...... p_{n-1} \times p_n$
\end{flushright}
probability that one of them is defective = $^{10}C_1 \times (0.95)^9 \times (0.05)$
\begin{flushright}
here $^{10}C_1$ indicates choosing one out 
of 10 items which is defective\\
0.05 indicates the probability that the 
choosen item to be defective\\
$(0.95)^9$ indicates the probability that 
the rest 9 items are non-defective\\
$\because$ probability of n independent \hspace*{1.8in} \\ events happening simultaneously= $p_1 \times p_2 \times ...... p_{n-1} \times p_n$
\end{flushright}
So the probability that 10 items does not have more than 1 defective item \\
\hspace*{3.5in}  $= (0.95)^{10}$ + $^{10}C_1 \times (0.95)^9 \times (0.05)$    \\
\hspace*{3.5in} $=0.9139$\\
\hspace*{3.5in} $=91.39 \%$
\begin{flushright}
$\because$ the probability of n mutually exclusive \hspace*{1.9in} \\events such that one of them happens = $p_1 + p_2 + ....+ p_{n-1} + p_n$
\end{flushright}
\textbf{$\therefore$ the the probability that 10 items does not have more than 1 defective item is 91.39\%}
